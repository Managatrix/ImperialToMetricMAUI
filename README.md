# Imperial To Metric MAUI
A little project to get my hands on creating and publishing a simple Blazor WASM app. The app is intended for mobile use, but as a Multi-platform App UI (MAUI), it should be usable on any device.
This project was created after I realized how hard it was to publish a PWA on Github Pages for mobile use (cf. my [PWA project](https://github.com/Managatrix/ImperialToMetricPWA)).

## Functionalities
Convert Imperial units to Metric and the other way around. Conversions include:
- Distance (Feet and Inches to Meters).
- Volume (Gallons, Quarts and Ounces to Litres).
- Mass (Pounds to Kilograms).
- Temperature (Fahrenheit to Celsius).
- Speed (mph to km/h).
- Fuel economy (mpg to km/100L).

## Goals
- Easy and fast to use. Easy to input and easy to read the output. Should make the use of the app worthwhile compared to doing the math in your head.
- Be able to install the app for offline use.
- Quick and without performance issues.
